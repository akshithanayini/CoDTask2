introduction 
An e-commerce website is an online platform that facilitates the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. These websites allow businesses to showcase their products, manage transactions, process payments securely, and handle shipping and delivery logistics. Customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases from the comfort of their own homes. E-commerce websites come in various forms, from simple online storefronts to complex marketplaces with multiple vendors. Examples include Amazon, eBay, and Shopify.
